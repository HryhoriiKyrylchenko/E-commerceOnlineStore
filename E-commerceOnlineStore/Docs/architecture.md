# System Architecture

## Overview

This document provides an overview of the system architecture for the ASP.NET Web API e-commerce platform. The system is designed to handle product management, user accounts, shopping cart operations, and order processing.

## Core Components

### 1. **API Layer**
- **Role**: This layer is responsible for handling HTTP requests and returning appropriate responses.
- **Controllers**:
  - Each controller handles a specific domain (e.g., `ProductController`, `OrderController`, `UserController`).
  - All controllers follow the **RESTful** API principles.
- **Routing**:
  - Uses **attribute-based routing** for organizing API endpoints.
  - Example routes: `/api/products`, `/api/orders`, `/api/auth`.

### 2. **Business Logic Layer**
- **Role**: Contains the core logic of the system, handling all business processes such as order creation, payment processing, and product recommendations.
- **Services**:
  - The **service layer** provides abstractions for the business logic.
  - Services include: `OrderService`, `ProductService`, `UserService`.
  - Follows the **Service Layer Pattern**.
- **Design Patterns**:
  - **Singleton Pattern**: For services that require a single instance (e.g., configuration services).
  - **Factory Pattern**: Used for creating objects that follow a particular business process (e.g., generating different payment processors).

### 3. **Data Access Layer**
- **Role**: Manages all interactions with the database.
- **Repositories**:
  - The **Repository Pattern** is used to abstract data access logic. Each entity has its own repository (e.g., `ProductRepository`, `OrderRepository`).
- **Unit of Work**:
  - The **Unit of Work Pattern** ensures that multiple database operations within the same transaction are either completed successfully or rolled back in case of failure.
- **Entity Framework Core**:
  - **ORM** (Object-Relational Mapper) used to interact with the SQL database.
  - Migrations are used to update the database schema as the application evolves.

### 4. **Security**
- **JWT Authentication**:
  - The system uses **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for user authentication and authorization.
  - Users authenticate via the `/api/auth` endpoints, receiving a token which is used for accessing protected resources.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:
  - Different roles (e.g., Admin, Customer) define access levels for the API endpoints.
- **SSL/TLS**:
  - All API requests are encrypted with **SSL** to ensure secure communication.

### 5. **Logging and Monitoring**
- **Application Insights**:
  - Integrated for real-time monitoring of performance and errors.
- **Logging**:
  - Uses built-in **ASP.NET logging** for application logs and error tracking.
  - **Serilog** can be integrated for more advanced log management.

## Design Patterns

### 1. **Repository Pattern**
Used to abstract and encapsulate the interaction with the database. Each domain (e.g., Products, Orders) has its own repository responsible for managing CRUD operations.

### 2. **Unit of Work Pattern**
Ensures that multiple database operations (such as saving an order and its items) are handled as part of a single transaction. This guarantees atomicity and data consistency.

### 3. **Dependency Injection (DI)**
ASP.NET Coreâ€™s built-in DI system is used to inject services, repositories, and other dependencies throughout the application.

### 4. **Service Layer Pattern**
The service layer contains business logic and mediates between the controller layer and the data access layer. This helps keep the controllers lean and focused on request handling.

## Modular Architecture

The application is divided into the following modules:

- **User Module**:
  - Handles user authentication, registration, and management.
  - Responsible for password hashing, JWT generation, and user roles.
  
- **Product Module**:
  - Manages product catalog, categories, product variants, and product reviews.
  - Includes functionality for listing products, searching, filtering, and product details.
  
- **Order Module**:
  - Handles shopping cart operations, order creation, and payment processing.
  - Manages order statuses, shipment tracking, and return requests.
  
- **Notification Module**:
  - Sends email and push notifications related to orders, promotions, and user activities.

## External Integrations

### 1. **Payment Gateway**
- **Stripe**: Used for processing payments, handling credit card transactions, and managing refunds.
- **Integration**: The payment gateway is abstracted into the service layer, allowing easy substitution if needed.

### 2. **Email Service**
- **SendGrid**: Used to send transactional emails (e.g., order confirmations, password resets).
- **Integration**: The email service is configured to use environment-based API keys for security.

## Conclusion

This architecture ensures that the system is scalable, modular, and maintainable. By following design patterns such as Repository, Unit of Work, and Dependency Injection, the system remains flexible and can be extended as needed.
